# corona_update_germany

This app should:

- Fetch news from official german news (Robert Koch Institute, Tagesschau.de, ...)
- Display a short summary of current statistics

Later on:

- Add region based filtering

Currently, I didn't spend the time to set up contribution guidelines, but feel free to
add your pull requests. Just keep in mind that I won't accept random useless features.
Before adding something meaningful, just ask be beforehand, whether that makes sense.
(Just create an issue as a feature request.)
